Questions:

MOVE ESTIMATION


MAP INTEGRATION

- Which path or set of paths does this pose currently overlap?
	getOrderedOverlappingPaths()
	- of all splices in local neighborhood, find the best fit based on highest contiguity in initial estimated pose
	- in order of best fits, pick the first that overlaps all constituent paths, that is, does not have paths in the splice beyond the range of the pose sensor data
	- for the constituent path IDs of the chosen splice, order them according to sequence they are overlapped by the pose curve
	- return the ordered list of path IDs that this pose curve overlaps

- Does this pose completely fit on the path splice or does it depart?
- Given the departure state of the splice, is the pose departure parameters sufficient for a new branch?
- Is the proposed new branch sufficiently different from existing branches?



Where to fit the path?
Does the pose fit on this path?
Does the pose cause a branch onto new path?
