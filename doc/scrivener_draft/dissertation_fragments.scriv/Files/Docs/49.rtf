\f0\fs28 \cf0 For two poses that are theoretically at the same location but are split for the forward and backward sweep, we need some way for reconciling their relative offset.  Taking the raw pose data and posture images, we see there are some discrepancies caused by the slip during the anchor transition.  We can fix this by performing an overlap fit using the same method between consecutive steps in inter-pose correction.\
\
The initial condition will be the poses located on top of each other and their medial axes intersecting near the origin points.   After performing an ICP fit to change the angle and the arc length displacement in the neighborhood, this creates a reasonable estimate transform between the two.}
