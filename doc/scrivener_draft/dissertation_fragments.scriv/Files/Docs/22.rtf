A solution to this problem would allow mapping and exploration of previously inaccessible environments.  An approach that is invariant to ambient fluid (air, water, muddy water) would significantly impact cave exploration and underground science by the access to still deeper and smaller cave arteries regardless of whether they are submerged in water.  Search and rescue operations would have additional tools for locating survivors in complicated debris piles or collapsed mines.  Utility service workers would be able to map and inspect pipe networks without having to excavate or interrupt services.\
