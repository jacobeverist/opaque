\f0\fs28 \cf0 A fundamental primitive problem when mapping confined environments is determing when two partially overlapping curve segments diverge from each other.  That is, at which point does curve A diverge from curve B.  See the attached figure.\
\
The definition of the divergence point is not obvious from the offset.  Given that the two curves are not exactly overlapping and that the instance where curve A begins its divergence, it is not clear where the point should be defined.  Generally, we want an extrapolation of where we think the intersection of two arms of a junction are intersecting.  This requires the extrapolation of the incoming direction of the divergent curve and intersect to its parent curve.\
\
We examine multiple approaches to this defiiniton.}
