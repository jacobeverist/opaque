\
 In this dissertation, we develop an algorithmic approach for robotically mapping confined environments using internal sensors only.  Some challenging environments such as underground caves and pipes are impossible to explore and map with external sensors.  Such environments often cause external sensors to fail because they are too confined, too hostile for the sensors, or incompatible to the fluid medium.  These environments are also impossible for humans to explore for similar reasons.  Robotic solutions are possible, but such environments often cause available external sensors to fail.  A robotic solution that can explore and map without external sensors would allow access to previously inaccessible environments. \
