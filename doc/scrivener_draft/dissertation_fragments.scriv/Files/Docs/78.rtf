\
 In this dissertation, we develop an algorithmic approach for robotically mapping confined environments using internal sensors only.  Some challenging environments such as underground caves and pipes are impossible to explore and map with the currently external sensor technology.  Such environments can be too confined or too hostile for humans to explore.  Robotic solutions are possible, but such environments often cause available external sensors to fail.  A robotic solution that can explore and map without external sensors would allow access to previously inaccessible environments. \
