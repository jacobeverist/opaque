	Abstract = {This paper presents a technique to improve the data association in the iterative closest point based scan matching. The method is based on a distance-filter constructed on the basis of an analysis of the set of solutions produced by the associations in the sensor configuration space. This leads to a robust strategy to filter all the associations that do not explain the principal motion of the scan (due to noise in the sensor, large odometry errors, spurious, occlusions or dynamic features for example). The experimental results suggest that the improvement of the data association leads to more robust and faster methods in the presence of wrong correspondences. ER  -},

@article{allen88,
	Abstract = {A robotic system for object recognition is described that uses passive stereo vision and active exploratory tactile sensing. The complementary nature of these sensing modalities allows the system to discover the underlying 3-D structure of the objects to be recognized. This structure is embodied in rich, hierarchical, viewpoint-independent 3-D models of the objects which include curved surfaces, concavities and holes. The vision processing provides sparse 3-D data about regions of interest that are then actively explored by the tactile sensor mounted on the end of a six-degree-of-freedom manipulator. A robust, hierarchical procedure has been developed to inte grate the visual and tactile data into accurate 3-D surface and feature primitives. This integration of vision and touch provides geometric measures of the surfaces and features that are used in a matching phase to find model objects that are consistent with the sensory data. Methods for verification of the hypothesis are presented, including the sensing of visually occluded areas with the tactile sensor. A number of experi ments have been performed using real sensors and real, noisy data to demonstrate the utility of these methods and the ability of such a system to recognize objects that would be difficult for a system using vision alone.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of robust data association for simultaneous vehicle localization and map building. We show that the classical gated nearest neighbor approach, which considers each matching between sensor observations and features independently, ignores the fact that measurement prediction errors are correlated. This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association. Unlike the nearest neighbor, this method provides a robust solution in complex situations, such as cluttered environments or when revisiting previously mapped regions ER  -},

	Abstract = {The authors consider the detection of small surface features, such as cracks, bumps, and ridges, on the surface of an object during haptic exploration and dexterous manipulation. Surface feature definition and detection are essential for intelligent haptic exploration and modeling of unknown objects. First, the authors review the representation of object surface geometry and present definitions of features based on local surface curvature. These definitions depend on both the geometry of the robot fingertips and the object being explored. It is also shown that the trajectory traced by a round fingertip rolling or sliding over the object surface has some intrinsic properties that facilitate feature detection. Several algorithms for feature detection based on feature definitions are described and compared, and simulated and experimental results are presented for feature detection using a hemispherical fingertip equipped with a tactile sensor.},

@article{jia96,
	Abstract = {Industrial assembly involves sensing the pose (orientation and position) of a part. Efficient and reliable sensing strategies can be developed for an assembly task if the shape of the part is known in advance. In this article we investigate two problems of determining the pose of a polygonal part of known shape for the cases of a continuum and a finite number of possible poses, respectively. The first problem, named sensing by inscription, involves determining the pose of a convex n-gon from a set of m sup porting cones. An algorithm with running time O(nm) that almost always reduces to O(n + m log n) is presented to solve for all possible poses of the polygon. We prove that the number of possible poses cannot exceed 6n, given m [\{\&}ge;] 2 supporting cones with distinct vertices. Simulation experiments demonstrate that two supporting cones are sufficient to determine the real pose of the n-gon in most cases. Our results imply that sensing in practice can be carried out by obtaining viewing angles of a planar part at multiple exterior sites in the plane. On many occasions a parts feeder will have reduced the number of possible poses of a part to a small finite set. Our second problem, named sensing by point sampling, is con cerned with a more general version: finding the minimum number of sensing points required to distinguish between n polygonal shapes with a total of m edges. In practice this can be implemented by embedding a series of point light detectors in a feeder tray or by using a set of mechanical probes that touch the feeder at a finite number of predeter mined points. We show that this problem is equivalent to an NP-complete set-theoretic problem introduced as Discriminat ing Set, and present an O(n2m2) approximation algorithm to solve it with a ratio of 2 In n. Furthermore, we prove that one can use an algorithm for Discriminating Set with ratio c log n to construct an algorithm for Set Covering with ratio c log n + O(log log n). Thus the ratio 2 In n is asymptotically optimal unless NP [sub] DTIME(npoly log n), a consequence of known results on approximating Set Covering. The complexity of subproblems of Discriminating Set is also analyzed, based on their relationship to a generalization of Independent Set called 3-Independent Set. Finally, simulation results suggest},

A weightless and frictionless environment is approximated using an air-hockey table where robots and structural components can float on the surface. The robots use fan propulsion to dock with components and assemble them together to make 2D structures. This system is designed to implement three key technologies for space self-assembly: 1) intelligent components with universal connectors, 2) a set of self-reconfigurable robots that fetch and assemble components, and 3) a distributed method for controlling the robotic-assembly process. An overview of the system's design and experimental results is presented. ER  -},

	Abstract = {Many important missions for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), such as undersea inspection of ship hulls, require integrated navigation, control, and motion planning in complex, 3D environments. This paper describes a SLAM implementation using forward-looking sonar (FLS) data from a highly maneuverable, hovering AUV performing a ship hull inspection mission. The exactly sparse extended information filter (ESEIF) algorithm is applied to perform SLAM based upon features manually selected within FLS images. The results demonstrate the ability to effectively map a ship hull in a challenging marine environment. This provides a foundation for future work in which real-time SLAM will be integrated with motion planning and control to achieve autonomous coverage of a complete ship hull. ER  -},

	Abstract = {Current work at NASA's Johnson Space Center is focusing on the identification and design of novel robotic archetypes to fill roles complimentary to current space robots during in-space assembly and maintenance tasks. Tendril, NASA's latest robot designed for minimally invasive inspection, is one system born of this effort. Inspired by the biology of snakes, tentacles, and climbing plants, the Tendril robot is a long slender manipulator that can extend deep into crevasses and under thermal blankets to inspect areas largely inaccessible by conventional means. The design of the Tendril, with its multiple bending segments and 1 cm diameter, also serves as an initial step in exploring the whole body control known to continuum robots coupled with the small scale and dexterity found in medical and commercial minimally invasive devices. An overview of Tendril's design is presented along with preliminary results from testing that seeks to improve Tendril's performance through an iterative design process ER  -},

@article{Werbos:1990p43,
	Abstract = {Basic backpropagation, which is a simple method now being widely used in areas like pattern recognition and fault diagnosis, is reviewed. The basic equations for backpropagation through time, and applications to areas like pattern recognition involving dynamic systems, systems identification, and control are discussed. Further extensions of this method, to deal with systems other than neural networks, systems involving simultaneous equations, or true recurrent networks, and other practical issues arising with the method are described. Pseudocode is provided to clarify the algorithms. The chain rule for ordered derivatives-the theorem which underlies backpropagation-is briefly discussed. The focus is on designing a simpler version of backpropagation which can be translated into computer code and applied directly by neutral network users ER  -},

@article{lee98,
	Abstract = {Over the past three decades, tactile sensing has developed into a sophisticated technology. There has been a longstanding and widely held expectation that tactile sensors would have a major impact on industrial robotics and automation. However, this promise has not been realized, and few, if any, tactile sensors can be found in factory-based applications. Has this technology failed to deliver its expected benefits to robotics applications, or have other factors influenced the development of the field? In this paper, I report on the state of the art and show that tactile sensing has undergone a major change of direction. I revisit the original predictions and expectations, examine the implications of recent reviews, and show how the field has altered course. From current activities and recent trends, I determine the nature of new application areas and pressing developments that hold much promise for the future. There is evidence that tactile sensing will soon play a major role in unstructured environments, particularly in areas such as medicine and surgery, health-care and service robotics, and automated natural product handling.},
